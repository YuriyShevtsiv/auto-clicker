# 🖱 Auto Clicker (Tkinter)

## 📌 Description

This project is a **simple Auto Clicker application** built with **Python and Tkinter**.
It allows the user to automatically click the mouse at a specified speed (clicks per second) using a graphical interface.

The application includes:

* Adjustable click speed
* Start and stop controls
* Global **ESC hotkey** to stop clicking
* Informational popups
* Ukrainian language interface

---

## 🛠 Requirements

* **Python 3.8+**
* Required Python libraries:

  * `tkinter` (included with Python)
  * `mouse`
  * `keyboard`

### Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install mouse keyboard
```

> ⚠️ **Note:**
> On some systems, the `mouse` and `keyboard` libraries may require **administrator/root privileges** to work correctly.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user enters the desired number of clicks per second.
2. The program calculates the delay between clicks:

   ```
   delay = 1000 / clicks_per_second
   ```
3. The function `schedule_click()`:

   * Performs a mouse click
   * Reschedules itself using `root.after()`
4. Clicking stops when:

   * The **ESC** key is pressed
   * The **Stop** button is clicked
   * The window is closed
